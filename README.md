### Project Description: Todo Management System

The **Todo Management System** is a robust and user-friendly application designed to help individuals or teams manage their tasks effectively. This system allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks (or "Todos"). It leverages modern software development principles and best practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.

#### Key Features:
1. **Create Todo**: Users can create new tasks with relevant details such as title, description, due dates, and priority levels.
2. **Update Todo**: Existing tasks can be updated with new information, allowing for flexible task management.
3. **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer necessary. This feature ensures that tasks are properly deleted from the system only if they exist.
   - If a task with the specified ID is found, it will be deleted from the system.
   - If no task is found with the given ID, the system will throw a descriptive exception (e.g., `TodoNotFoundException`), providing better error handling.
4. **Retrieve Todos**: The system offers functionality to retrieve individual or all tasks, enabling users to track and organize their to-do lists efficiently.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The core programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework to build microservices, providing a RESTful API for interacting with the Todo data.
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Used for seamless interaction with the database, ensuring data persistence.
- **Optional API**: This Java feature is employed to handle null values gracefully, avoiding `NullPointerExceptions` and ensuring better code readability and maintainability.
- **Custom Exception Handling**: For better error management, custom exceptions like `TodoNotFoundException` are implemented to provide descriptive feedback in case of errors.
- **TodoRepository**: Responsible for accessing the database, typically an interface extending `JpaRepository` that provides CRUD operations on Todo entities.

#### Example Workflow:
1. **Delete Todo Logic**:
   - The system provides a method `deleteTodo(long id)` that looks up a task based on the `id`.
   - If the task exists, it is deleted.
   - If the task does not exist, a `TodoNotFoundException` is thrown, ensuring the system properly notifies the user when an invalid task ID is referenced.

#### Sample Code for Delete Todo:
```java
public void deleteTodo(long id) {
    Optional<Todo> todoById = getTodoById(id);
    Todo todo = todoById.orElseThrow(() -> new TodoNotFoundException("Todo with id " + id + " not found"));
    todoRepository.delete(todo);
}
```

### Potential Use Cases:
- **Personal Task Management**: Users can manage their daily tasks, set priorities, and organize to-do lists.
- **Team Collaboration**: This system can be extended to support team-based task management where multiple users collaborate on tasks and projects.
- **Reminders and Deadlines**: The Todo system can help remind users of due dates and provide alerts for pending or overdue tasks.

### Future Enhancements:
- **User Authentication**: Adding user login and registration to ensure that todos are managed on a per-user basis.
- **Task Categories**: Allowing tasks to be grouped into categories such as "Work," "Personal," etc.
- **Notifications**: Implementing email or in-app notifications for task deadlines and reminders.

This system aims to streamline task management while maintaining a clean, simple, and efficient codebase. It leverages modern Java practices like the `Optional` class and custom exceptions to handle scenarios where a task might not exist, ensuring graceful error handling and a smooth user experience.
